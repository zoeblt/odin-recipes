    <img src="../images/bakedbrie.jpg"baked brie>
    <p>This is a great appitizer or side dish for a veriety of dishes. The first time I had it was with salmon, and I have made it with salads and pasta. But would also go well with steak or soups! There are many different ways to do baked brie, sweet, savory, nutty, fruity, the possibilitys are endless!</p>
    <p>My baked brie is more on the savory side. I usualy use president cheese brand, super easy to find, and not too pricey. But double or tripple cream ones are amazing for baked brie.</p>
