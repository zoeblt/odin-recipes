        <p>This is an fast, easy and delicious rescipe that the whole family will love. This is where usually a 
            pinterst blogger will take 10 paragraphs to tell a story about her 3 year olds first day of school, her husbands highschool 
            football team, or how she rescued her pursumablely adorable and 
            funny golden retriver. I have decided to spare you from all that and actually talk about the recipe at hand</p>
            <p>You can go a few differnt ways with a stuffed pepper rescipe. Italian; ground beef with italian spices, perhaps cooked in red sause, topped with mozzerella.
                 Mexican; ground beef cooked with taco seasoning, stuffed with cream cheese and topped with sharp chedder and jalapeños. 
                Greek; Ground beef or chicken seasoned 
                with garam masala, topped with feta, tomato and cucumber salad and a bit of tasiki. Today we will be trying our hand at my personal favorite, Mexican stuffed peppers.</p>
                <p>But before we start let me give some commentary on the different colors of bell peppers. My mom always tells me I'm crazy when I say that yellow bell peppers are my favorite. Most people think there is no difference between the colors.
                     Flavor wise, thats mostly true
                    but yellow is my favorite because of the texture. Green peppers are the most crunchy, to me a little too crunchy. They need to be baked longer to get to a better texture. Yellow ones are nice and crispy and sometimes 
                    even slightly sweeter. Orange is pretty much the same as yellow. Then theres red. Raw red peppers are amazing. Cooked red peppers are a different story for me. To me they are akin to tomatos. I love raw tomatos, the texture when cooked?
                     No thank you.
                If red is cooked for too long, the skin starts to fall off and it starts to get a little mushy. If you don't find that texture, thats the pepper for you. Though if you're like me, stick with yellow and orange. Alright, now onto the recipe.   </p>
