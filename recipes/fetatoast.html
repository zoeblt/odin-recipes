    <p>This is a family favorite easy appitizer. I prefer persian cucumbers for this recipe. They are the perfect crunch, theres no need to peel them and their seeds are nice and small!.</p>
    <p>As for the kind of feta to use, the creamier the better. For your average grocery, they will most likely have Athenos and/or president cheese brand. I much prefer Athenos for both flavor and creaminess (though president is a great band for our next recipe, baked brie). But if you have a local deli or such that has block feta, that is usually the best! And the best of all in my opinion is the Trader Joes block feta with the orange lable. They also have block feta in water that is made with goat milk, that is probably also delicious with this recipe, I am just not a goat milk fan. </p>
